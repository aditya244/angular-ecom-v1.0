algo for pagination
  - variables required
    - counter variable starts with 0
    - page number starts with 1
    - number of items per page -> 5 for eg
  - the initial api call is made (for page no 1)
    - to filter the data the counter value will get to action,
    - counter value will range from
      - page number - 1 * number of items per page , and will run as many times as items per page
      - 1 - 1 (0) to 5 times -> 5 loops, 0 to 4
      - for 1st page, 0,1,2,3,4 (5 items are rendered)
  - next page call / random page call
    - grab the page number. (take 3 as example)
    - counter range will be from page num -> (3 - 1 = 2) * 5 = 10 to 5 times (10,11,12,13,14,15 -> counter range)

  - the data from the api call will be filtered in such a way if page number is 1, then items to render will be 1 * number of items per page
  - i.e. if page renders 5 per page, then for first page, it renders 1 * 5, i.e first 5 elements of the array.
  - and the counter will be increae after every page.
  - data render in page logic will be.
   - for 1st page, counter is 0, number of items in a page is 5 and page number is 1
   - so the number of items rendered is 5*1 and the counter for the array will start from zero and increment to the number of items required.
   - Thus for page 1, only items 0 - 4 will be rendered.
   - for page 2, the counter will be at 5 (last recorded was 4), no of items in a page is 5, and page number is 2.
- the counter value should be page number * number of items per page - 1, as we are starting from 0,
  - and will go upto the number of items oer page
